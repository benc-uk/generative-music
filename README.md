#Random Ambient Music Procedurally Generated (RAMPg)

Idea and code taken from Christopher Alcock's wonderful <a href='http://variousmusicappsofchris.herokuapp.com/sym2'/>'Procedural cycle of thirds ambient thing'</a>. Which I have modified and mangled and slightly expanded to send MIDI

You will need a computer with a MIDI interface. The code only generates MIDI note on &amp; off messages, so for sounds to be heard you'll also need a synthesizer (or several synths / MIDI sound sources) each set to the relevant channels.
